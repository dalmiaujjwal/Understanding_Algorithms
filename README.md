# Understanding_Algorithms
##### Discusses every ML algorithm in detail

The purpose of this repository is to maintain the python codes which were written to develop an understanding of various ML algorithms. For each algorithm there are 3 Jupyter Notebooks:
- **Implementation from scratch** - This helps in understanding the math behind the algorithms and hence figuring out situations where it can give undesired results. Each implementation is done on a real life dataset which is also made available in the repository.
- **Impact of Hyperparameters** - Deciding the value of hyperparameters is an important task in ML. Though this can be done programmatically, but understanding the impact of hyperparameters on predictions is an important aspect and should be studied in detail.
- **Implementation using available packages** - The first 2 steps were primarily to set up the foundations. In this step, we understand the approach to implement the algorithms using available Python packages.

Note:
1. All the codes are written purely from the perspective of implementation therefore, the code optimization aspect is completely ignored. This is primarily because most of the existing libraries offer an optimized implementation of these algorithms.
2. Explanation of all the codes is available in associated medium posts
